\message{ !name(rev.tex) !offset(159) }


\cc{--- Related to this, although the author analyses that "the highly-developed
  Nordic countries (DK, FI, NO, SE)" show "the positive relationship between
  energy consumption and happiness" (page 4, line 17-22), they are rather the
  cases representing the insignificance of energy use to happiness above a
  certain threshold.}

We have clarified now by rearranging text. What we meant is that they lie at the top right of fig1
panel1, so that they contribute or drive the relationship having large leverage
on regression fit and making the relationship stronger. We did not mean that
there is a positive relationship across these places, just simply meant that
they are high on both, happiness and energy consumption.

\cc{--- In contrast, the following sentence "At the country level, the lower the energy consumption, given development level, the happier the country." (page 8, line 46-48) seems contradictory with the overall argument of this article and the finding in Figure 1(1) in particular.}

We clarified by adding the reference to Panel 2 in Figure 1.

\cc{- Although the author views that "With a notable exception of California, energy use is not decreasing" (page 8, line 34-36) in the US, it does not match with Figure 3. Indeed, 2 or 3 regions move downward, 2 or 3 regions standstill and only 3 regions upward. Nonetheless, this (i.e. downward and standstill trends in many areas in the US) seems not intuitive and needs explanation if the data are correct.}

Yes! What we meant actually is that California has been the leader, but of course, we did
not say it clearly. Now it has been clarified: we specifically name new england
and pacific as 2 regions that experienced declines.


\cc{- At the end of the article (page 10, line 53- page 11, line 5), the author
  introduces the impact of pollution on the relation between energy consumption
  and happiness but skipped the investigation simply by leaving the finding in
  the supplementary material. If it is introduced in the main text, it needs to
  be examined; otherwise, it would be better to drop it all together from the
  article.}

Another great point! We dropped it altogether and we will work on a follow-up
paper focusing on it.

\cc{[Minor points]
- "98\% of US emissions" (page 1, line 44) What emissions?}

carbon dioxide; fixed in text

\cc{- "a co-inventor of HDI, Amartya Sen, has proposed happiness as better
  measure of overall development or progress (Stiglitz et al. 2009)" (page 2,
  line 8-10). Sen is not a good reference here. Although he acknowledges the
  importance of happiness and subjective well-being to make informational space
  for evaluation broader, he stresses the significance of assessing well-being
  objectively in consideration of the risk of adaptive preferences. Given that
  the report was written by many contributors, it is most likely that this point
  was advocated by others.}

\section*{Response to Reviewer \#2} 
\cc{In recent years an interest has developed in comparing quality of life on both sides of the Atlantic. This paper gives a refreshingly crisp report on why are there such marked differences in satisfaction with working hours in the US and Europe, a topic that according to the author is underrepresented in the QOL literature. The author pits cultural against economic reasons to explain preferences for longer and shorter working hours. An excursion into the value attached to work in the two study contexts suggests an explanation (see Table 2 and Figure 3). A major strength is the care taken to harmonise relevant data collected on both sides of the Atlantic.}

\rr{n/a} N/A

\cc{Quibbles:\\
Tables and graphs in the text are kept to a minimum. The remainder of the evidence is placed in the
appendices. This seems to work well.}

\rr{n/a} N/A


\cc {However, readers might like to see the questions contained in Tables 8 and 9 repeated in the
  legends to Tables 9 - 16, and Tables 18-20.} 

\rr{10-19//}  To make the appendices more concise I decreased spacing in tables from
1.5 to 1.0. As a result, there are now on average 3 tables per page instead of 2, and it is easier to
find them. Also length of the
manuscript decreased from  26 to 22 pages, which  saves space in the journal. Repeating questions in
legends will take up space and not clarify much: frequency tables are fairly self-explanatory.

\cc{The alignment of several items in Table 8 is incorrect and the wording of the item on the showcard for 'GSS friends' is missing: say: 'How often do you see your friends?'}

\rr{13//}  I fixed the alignment in Table 8 in column 1. And added ``Spend a social evening with friends who live outside the neighborhood?''


\section*{Reviewer \#3}

\cc{ This paper intends to explain the difference between Europeans and Americans
on work and happiness. It finds that Europeans work to live and Americans live to work. This is
indeed a cultural explanation which deserves attention of the academic field in the study of
subjective wellbeing.}

\rr{n/a} N/A

\cc{ In my view, the litmus test of this paper for acceptance of publication is
whether it uses the same measure of subjective wellbeing; as life satisfaction and happiness are
different, despite both are subjective wellbeing. The paper recognizes this difference and clearly
illustrates it in footnote no. 3, but it makes it clear that they are used interchangeably. This is
fine if two concepts are the same; however, when we go to the measurement -the Europeans were asked
about the extent of satisfaction "with the life you (respondents) lead"; so, this is a life
satisfaction measure. To the Americans, the question they were asked is the extent of happiness of
"things are these days";
so, this is a happiness measure. Therefore, the Europeans were asked about a cognitive judgment of
their life; a long period of time up to the moment they were interviewed. But Americans were asked
differently - "things are these days" indicates a shorter span of time and the idea is only about an
affective mood - happiness, without any cognitive evaluation as in the case of life satisfaction. In
other words, both concepts should not be treated as the same on the operational level in this
paper.}

\rr{5/2/6} This wording difference was acknowledged in the paper:

\begin{quote}
 Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least one other paper used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03}). 
\end{quote}

\noindent\citet[2013/2/11]{alesina03} defended this approach arguing that:
\begin{quote}
 ``happiness'' and ``life satisfaction'' are
highly correlated. 
\end{quote}


\noindent I reviewed recent literature and found another published paper  using the same survey items. \citet[211/2/20]{stevenson09w} defend this approach arguing that:  
\begin{quote}
While life satisfaction and happiness are somewhat different
concepts, responses are highly correlated.
\end{quote}

\noindent \citet{alesina03} \citet{stevenson09w} are able to make statements about correlations and compare
happiness with life satisfaction because there was happiness question in addition to life
satisfaction question in Eurobarometer until 1986
(still, they use life satisfaction measure because it is available for more years).
I use Eurobarometers in 1998 and 2001 (these are the only datasets with working hours available
for Europe) and I have to use ``life satisfaction'' measure. Both, \citet{alesina03} and
\citet{stevenson09w} use \underline{exactly the same survey items as this paper uses} to compare
happiness in the U.S. and Europe.

\rr{5/2/6} I have changed text FROM:

\begin{quote}
 Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least one other paper used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03}). 
\end{quote}

\noindent TO:

\begin{quote}
Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least two other papers used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03, stevenson09w}). ``Happiness'' and ``Life
Satisfaction'' measures are highly correlated. 
\end{quote}

\noindent Still, using different measures may be a limitation of this study, and this pertains to
independent variables as well. This limitation is acknowledged by adding  
footnote 5 on p. 5.

\begin{quote}
 Still, robustness of the results can be improved if wording of the survey
 questions is the same for all respondents. This remains for the future research when better data
 become available.
\end{quote}


\cc{Of course, a composite index combining both happiness and life satisfaction is a solution;
but unfortunately, this paper does not have it for this comparative study on subjective wellbeing
between Europeans and Americans. On the basis of this assessment, I do not recommend to accept the
paper for publication in its present form.}

\rr{n/a} If I understand this comment correctly, reviewer asks to combine happiness for the
U.S. with life satisfaction for Europe, but I believe this to be a misunderstanding: In order to
combine two different  measures into an index they need to be observed for the same
 individuals. This is not the case here: there is happiness for Americans and life satisfaction for Europeans.

\noindent The only way to create an index is to find both happiness and life satisfaction measures in the same
dataset, but they do not
exist. Again, this is not a serious limitation because happiness and life satisfaction
are highly correlated and the very same measures as used in this paper are successfully used in the
literature  \citep{alesina03, stevenson09w}.
