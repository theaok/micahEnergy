\section{Response to Reviewer \#1} 


\cc{It is unclear that which regression models were used in the paper. The
  author(s) should describe the models in details ( fixed or random
  effects???). It should be noted that correlation analysis does not imply
  causal effects. How about other controlling variables such as corruption, social capital, religion, inequality}

Thank you for suggestion to include corruption, social capital, religion and
inequality. We do think that it is a great idea. We will be incorporating your
advice, however, in a follow-up study.  

We did follow your
advice. We added religiosity and social capital from World Values Survey
(WVS). However, social capital variables are missing for more than half of the
sample. We also added corruption from the World
Bank and we tried multiple sources for Gini: World Bank Development Indicators, 
and finally found probably most comprehensive
\url{http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/all-the-ginis} which has recent
years available, but unfortunately, most observations are missing. Deininger,
Klaus and Lyn Squire dataset is more complete but only till 1980s or early
1990s, while happiness data at broad spatial coverage starts from 2000s.
Again, the goal of this study is breadth, not depth, we want to cover as many
areas as possible. Taken together, addition of controls would cut sample size by
more than half. % We could still estimate regressions for say only European
% countries, but this study does not focus on Europe only.
\\

We start with a general clarification.
The heart of this paper is exploration of simple bivariate relationship of
energy use and happiness at multiple levels of spatial aggregation: county,
state, country, and over time--we use the most comprehensive data available in
spatial and temporal dimensions.
We connect two largely separate fields: energy
research and happiness research. Indeed, there is barely any other topic that is
more important than climate change or energy use that causes it and yet there is
also hardly any other topic that received less attention with respect to
happiness. This is the contribution of this study.
\\

Analysis of multiple predictors of happiness in addition to energy use is a
great idea, and we will pursue it in follow-up research because it would
 force us to change the focus of current study--addition of controls will
 severely limit our broad coverage.
\\

Importantly, as reviewer also points out, addition of controls
wouldn't help much, as there is endogeneity, and as explained below, our search
for appropriate natural experiment will take many more months, and we believe
our findings are timely and informative for the current debates about climate
change, energy use, and subjective wellbeing.


\cc{Energy use is endogenous, is likely to be affected by income per capita, how can the authors deal with this issue?}

We agree that endogeneity is important and we agree that energy use is
endogenous. However, we cannot tackle it using these data. While we do not
tackle it in this study, we do not sweep under the rug, and we acknowledge it
now in text.  How would we try to deal with it in a follow-up study?
 Following \citep{sorensen12}, we would
 try to find a way to argue that variation in energy use was independent from
 other variables in the model. We are not sure what variables could serve as
 good 
 instruments, but we think we may be able to find some natural experiment, for
 instance, when energy consumption was disrupted by natural disaster, or power
 plant or electric grid failure. We are also thinking to look at oil and natural gas disruptions--embargoes, shortages, dramatic price increases, etc. It is,  however, multi-month, possibly multi-year, research. 

To do it properly (including treatment of endogeneity and collection of all
relevant controls), would require
time, and we think that our current correlational results are already worthwhile
and interesting, especially given timeliness of the topic and public debates
around energy and happiness--yet, the debates are separate, and we would like to
 connect them and make an impact with this study as soon as possible. In short, as opposed to
doing a quick and arguably sloppy analysis within the revision timeframe for
JOHS, we think it is more useful to present simple current
bivariate results; and at the same time we are starting to work on a follow-up
paper that would provide a much more comprehensive treatment including multiple
controls and attempts at tackling endogeneity.\\ 

Paper is simply correlational and observational. Graphs in the body of the paper
present simple bivariate linear or quadratic fit. Only in the appendix there were some initial exploratory results using
multivariate regressions. We clarify it now in text that we only analyze energy
use and happiness, and to avoid confusion we drop our initial exploratory regressions from the supplementary material--again, we believe it is better
to postpone it for the follow-up paper for reasons discussed above.
\\

Of course, we agree that results are not causal, and we now make it clearer in
paper. And we also add a brief discussion making the case that our
correlational results are worthwhile--see tracked changes.
\\

Again, thank you very much for valuable feedback--it will help us in our current
work to extend this study.

\section{Response to Reviewer \#2} 

\cc{This article addresses the relation between energy use and happiness by investigating the energy intensity of GDP and by analyzing the inter-state variation of happiness in relation to energy use over time. I am not sure about the added-value of the second issue, the first issue is worthwhile. However, because of the reasons described below, this article seem not reach the quality to be accepted by the JOHS.}


\cc{[Major points]
- Overall, many parts of the argument have been disturbed due to poor writing. It would be better to invite a senior scholar or someone familiar with writing articles in English.}

One of us is a senior scholar and a native speaker, and the ms has been fixed.

\textbf{TODO Micah} %or Rubia or David Salas (he studies energy!)

\cc{- The relation between energy use and happiness seems very similar to the relation between economic growth and happiness (i.e. the Happiness Paradox). It is self-evident given that economic growth generally moves together with energy use. Although the author partially argues about this point and simply states that "finding the cause is left for the future research" (page 9, line 34) in the section of conclusion and policy implications, the connection between the finding and the Happiness Paradox would be better to be treated as central and investigated.}

Yes, indeed, this is a truly great point--we overlooked importance of it. We emphasize it much
better now. We have even changed the title and abstract to point to centrality of
this finding. We thank you very much for this point! We add more discussion in
text--see tracked changes.
Yet, in text we continue to keep the focus on energy use, and not income. We add
 some additional analyses focused on income in supplementary material.
% Also, one reason is technical--there is overlap between
% observations and cross-sectional graph needs to be really big.
% Analytical part of paper is mainly about cross-sectional results and we put
% additional time-series graphs in supplementary online material
\\

As a sidenote, at more aggregated levels, over time, energy  actually decouples from GDP:\\
{\footnotesize
\url{https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/01/17/can-we-sever-the-link-between-energy-and-growth}, and\\
\url{https://thinkprogress.org/u-s-economic-growth-decouples-from-both-energy-and-electricity-use-16ae78732e95}
}

\cc{--- Related to this, although the author analyses that "the highly-developed
  Nordic countries (DK, FI, NO, SE)" show "the positive relationship between
  energy consumption and happiness" (page 4, line 17-22), they are rather the
  cases representing the insignificance of energy use to happiness above a
  certain threshold.}

What we meant initially is that they lie at the top right of fig1
panel1, so that they contribute or drive the relationship having some leverage
on quadratic regression fit and making the relationship steeper or stronger. 
\\

Now given your comment, we have another look at it and realize that while they
lie above the quadratic fit, they also lie below linear fit (except DK), so
indeed, you are correct that they signify flattening out relationship.
We have clarified now by changing and rearranging text.

\cc{--- In contrast, the following sentence "At the country level, the lower the energy consumption, given development level, the happier the country." (page 8, line 46-48) seems contradictory with the overall argument of this article and the finding in Figure 1(1) in particular.}


We clarified by adding the reference to Panel 2 in Figure 1. We meant that while
 the bivariate relationship is positive (panel 1 of fig 1),  when taking
 account of income (panel 2 of fig 1) the relationship is positive.

\cc{- Although the author views that "With a notable exception of California, energy use is not decreasing" (page 8, line 34-36) in the US, it does not match with Figure 3. Indeed, 2 or 3 regions move downward, 2 or 3 regions standstill and only 3 regions upward. Nonetheless, this (i.e. downward and standstill trends in many areas in the US) seems not intuitive and needs explanation if the data are correct.}

Yes! What we meant actually is that California has been the leader in
sustainable development, but of course, we did
not say it clearly. Now it has been clarified: we specifically name new england
and pacific as 2 regions that experienced declines.


\cc{- At the end of the article (page 10, line 53- page 11, line 5), the author
  introduces the impact of pollution on the relation between energy consumption
  and happiness but skipped the investigation simply by leaving the finding in
  the supplementary material. If it is introduced in the main text, it needs to
  be examined; otherwise, it would be better to drop it all together from the
  article.}

Another great point! We dropped it altogether and we will work on a follow-up
paper focusing on it. We tried to expand on pollution but we had troubles
finding appropriate controls for many countries, and it will take more time than
we expected. 

\cc{[Minor points]
- "98\% of US emissions" (page 1, line 44) What emissions?}

carbon dioxide; fixed in text

\cc{- "a co-inventor of HDI, Amartya Sen, has proposed happiness as better
  measure of overall development or progress (Stiglitz et al. 2009)" (page 2,
  line 8-10). Sen is not a good reference here. Although he acknowledges the
  importance of happiness and subjective well-being to make informational space
  for evaluation broader, he stresses the significance of assessing well-being
  objectively in consideration of the risk of adaptive preferences. Given that
  the report was written by many contributors, it is most likely that this point
  was advocated by others.}


Excellent point! After giving it more thought, we completely agree--we added a
footnote with clarification--nevertheless, we decided to leave Sen in text
because that paragraph discusses HDI, and hence Sen is relevant to the
discussion. We also replaced ``better measure'' with ``a measure''--as you are
probably right that Sen would still prefer ``more objective'' indicators.
\\

We thank you for helpful comments--they have improved this paper, and
they will help us with follow-up papers on this topic.

\section*{Response to Reviewer \#2} 
\cc{In recent years an interest has developed in comparing quality of life on both sides of the Atlantic. This paper gives a refreshingly crisp report on why are there such marked differences in satisfaction with working hours in the US and Europe, a topic that according to the author is underrepresented in the QOL literature. The author pits cultural against economic reasons to explain preferences for longer and shorter working hours. An excursion into the value attached to work in the two study contexts suggests an explanation (see Table 2 and Figure 3). A major strength is the care taken to harmonise relevant data collected on both sides of the Atlantic.}

\rr{n/a} N/A

\cc{Quibbles:\\
Tables and graphs in the text are kept to a minimum. The remainder of the evidence is placed in the
appendices. This seems to work well.}

\rr{n/a} N/A


\cc {However, readers might like to see the questions contained in Tables 8 and 9 repeated in the
  legends to Tables 9 - 16, and Tables 18-20.} 

\rr{10-19//}  To make the appendices more concise I decreased spacing in tables from
1.5 to 1.0. As a result, there are now on average 3 tables per page instead of 2, and it is easier to
find them. Also length of the
manuscript decreased from  26 to 22 pages, which  saves space in the journal. Repeating questions in
legends will take up space and not clarify much: frequency tables are fairly self-explanatory.

\cc{The alignment of several items in Table 8 is incorrect and the wording of the item on the showcard for 'GSS friends' is missing: say: 'How often do you see your friends?'}

\rr{13//}  I fixed the alignment in Table 8 in column 1. And added ``Spend a social evening with friends who live outside the neighborhood?''


\section*{Reviewer \#3}

\cc{ This paper intends to explain the difference between Europeans and Americans
on work and happiness. It finds that Europeans work to live and Americans live to work. This is
indeed a cultural explanation which deserves attention of the academic field in the study of
subjective wellbeing.}

\rr{n/a} N/A

\cc{ In my view, the litmus test of this paper for acceptance of publication is
whether it uses the same measure of subjective wellbeing; as life satisfaction and happiness are
different, despite both are subjective wellbeing. The paper recognizes this difference and clearly
illustrates it in footnote no. 3, but it makes it clear that they are used interchangeably. This is
fine if two concepts are the same; however, when we go to the measurement -the Europeans were asked
about the extent of satisfaction "with the life you (respondents) lead"; so, this is a life
satisfaction measure. To the Americans, the question they were asked is the extent of happiness of
"things are these days";
so, this is a happiness measure. Therefore, the Europeans were asked about a cognitive judgment of
their life; a long period of time up to the moment they were interviewed. But Americans were asked
differently - "things are these days" indicates a shorter span of time and the idea is only about an
affective mood - happiness, without any cognitive evaluation as in the case of life satisfaction. In
other words, both concepts should not be treated as the same on the operational level in this
paper.}

\rr{5/2/6} This wording difference was acknowledged in the paper:

\begin{quote}
 Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least one other paper used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03}). 
\end{quote}

\noindent\citet[2013/2/11]{alesina03} defended this approach arguing that:
\begin{quote}
 ``happiness'' and ``life satisfaction'' are
highly correlated. 
\end{quote}


\noindent I reviewed recent literature and found another published paper  using the same survey items. \citet[211/2/20]{stevenson09w} defend this approach arguing that:  
\begin{quote}
While life satisfaction and happiness are somewhat different
concepts, responses are highly correlated.
\end{quote}

\noindent \citet{alesina03} \citet{stevenson09w} are able to make statements about correlations and compare
happiness with life satisfaction because there was happiness question in addition to life
satisfaction question in Eurobarometer until 1986
(still, they use life satisfaction measure because it is available for more years).
I use Eurobarometers in 1998 and 2001 (these are the only datasets with working hours available
for Europe) and I have to use ``life satisfaction'' measure. Both, \citet{alesina03} and
\citet{stevenson09w} use \underline{exactly the same survey items as this paper uses} to compare
happiness in the U.S. and Europe.

\rr{5/2/6} I have changed text FROM:

\begin{quote}
 Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least one other paper used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03}). 
\end{quote}

\noindent TO:

\begin{quote}
Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least two other papers used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03, stevenson09w}). ``Happiness'' and ``Life
Satisfaction'' measures are highly correlated. 
\end{quote}

\noindent Still, using different measures may be a limitation of this study, and this pertains to
independent variables as well. This limitation is acknowledged by adding  
footnote 5 on p. 5.

\begin{quote}
 Still, robustness of the results can be improved if wording of the survey
 questions is the same for all respondents. This remains for the future research when better data
 become available.
\end{quote}


\cc{Of course, a composite index combining both happiness and life satisfaction is a solution;
but unfortunately, this paper does not have it for this comparative study on subjective wellbeing
between Europeans and Americans. On the basis of this assessment, I do not recommend to accept the
paper for publication in its present form.}

\rr{n/a} If I understand this comment correctly, reviewer asks to combine happiness for the
U.S. with life satisfaction for Europe, but I believe this to be a misunderstanding: In order to
combine two different  measures into an index they need to be observed for the same
 individuals. This is not the case here: there is happiness for Americans and life satisfaction for Europeans.

\noindent The only way to create an index is to find both happiness and life satisfaction measures in the same
dataset, but they do not
exist. Again, this is not a serious limitation because happiness and life satisfaction
are highly correlated and the very same measures as used in this paper are successfully used in the
literature  \citep{alesina03, stevenson09w}.
