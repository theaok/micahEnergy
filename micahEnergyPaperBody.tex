\begin{abstract}
\noindent We study energy use and happiness across US census divisions, states,
and California counties.  Energy
use is defined in several ways, for instance,  residential electricity and gas consumption per capita at both,
county and state levels. Happiness data come
 from General Social Survey and from Centers for Disease Control. We control for known predictors of happiness
such as income, health and unemployment. There are striking differences in
energy use across areas within the US--differences are as large as several
fold. We find that areas consuming more energy are not happier (with possible
exception of transportation sector).
 We interpret this finding as another argument to conserve energy and consume
 less. Fundamentally, the ultimate goal of increased energy consumption is human
 happiness--if there is no relationship between the two, then we can
 consume less.

\section{Introduction}

energy consumption is important--people wage war for that...Many countries whole
economies are based on energy exports (e.g. OPEC countries)--many other
countries rely heavily on energy production and some use it as a political tool
, e.g. Russia. 
and aleays seek to get more--fracking etc
but focus of this jou and this paper is on conservation :)
the basic idea being that if there is not much happiness gained from energy
consumption then it would be another, and important, reason for energy
conservation. 


\section{The Happiness-Energy Conservation Tradeoff?}

A common or received wisdom is that tradeoff between happiness and energy
use--we need to consume energy in order to achieve greater happiness. This is
true in buivaraite case--the richer areas are happier.
 We argue
here that it is not necassarily so, only after taking into account income at
country level and few other variables at state or county levels, the
relationship between energyu consymptiona nd happiness disappears.


its striking 2 fold or more differences between states like nj and tx and only a
small fracton of that is due to climate most due to consumption arguably
wateful/conspicous--calculate how mich explained by climate! give number


 energy consumption is an obvious environmental problem
--cite taht comssission website

There is anectodal evidence pointing to the fact that humans can live happily
without much energy--among Amish, African Maasai, and Greenlandic Inughuit, most
people are above neutral in well-being.


It is striking then that large happiness literature has omitted topic of energy
so far--threre ano studies about energy consumption and happiness in an area,
but there are few studies about personal happiness as discussed later.

What do we know so far. Two landmark studies--NEW and welch paper in ecologica
econ--discuss them here

related literature is about poolution and happiness CITE; there is even
literature about happiness and attitudes about conservation CITEe.g. i guess i
ecol econ; but strikingly there is no research about energy consumprtion and
happiness with 2 exceptions--research by csikamisky one desctibed below, and the
other one is just came out 2014


\section{Model}

We analyse data in a cross-ection--there is not much variation over time for
instance in US and West-European countries %look at world.do: manheim or
                                %states.do for us states
 but there is lots of varaition across areas

It is critical to control for percoent urban or population density, because
urban or dense areas are less happy and more energy efficient, and hence
omission of this variable leads to positive bias on energy use--the estimated
coefficient   is larger than it should be in a bivariate case. Indeed, bivariate
relationship appears positive. 

The bottom line is that there appears to be weak relationshio betwen electricity
consumption and happiness, but it disappears or indeed becomes negative when
taking into account social support. one explanation is that people who consumer
more electricity, need to work more, and have less time for social stuff which
is iomportant for happiness. Per Bowling Alone, we do less and less social stuff
and robert frank--need to focus on non-epruniary domain!

states:
There are large differences in energy use per capita accross states--twofold or
larger, yet energy-hungry states are no happier (with possible exceptioon of
transportation sector)--this is just another argument for energy conservation.

\section{Future Research}

We just examined total energy use per capita at country level without
differentiating between sectors, because we could not find ssuch data. There are
however enrgy use data by sector for smaller sets of countries--for instance for
Europe available from Eurostat
